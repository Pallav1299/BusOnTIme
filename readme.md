# BUS ON TIME #

Public Transport has always been a preferred mode of transport for many, due to economical fares and some reliability. Now, the scenario has changed. People now prefer to use their private vehicles or cabs for travelling due to more comfort and reliability as compared to public transport. This has led to an increase in the number of private vehicles as compared to public transport, as a result, we experience long traffic lines during a certain time period of the day.
Also, more number of vehicles imply higher carbon emission and hence higher pollution.

What is the solution to this increasing traffic?

We devised a solution to this problem. Although similar solutions have already been developed, we have some unique traits which are new as compared to the already available solution in the market. We plan to make the bus transport services more reliable and make it more consistent. This will attract more users towards public bus transport as the majority of the population faces issues with the inconsistency of the buses and no specific timings.
